*results_rf_030422_trans_wf - the original transformed wf run
*results_rf_030822_rich - region analysis with rich features
*results_rf_050622_trans - adding the t_time
*results_rf_090522_region - region run
*results_rf_100522_chance_balanced - the chance level
*results_rf_110822_rich_v2 - only spatial with the summary statistics and NO individual chunk values, includes chunk sizes of 1, 5, and 10
*results_rf_160822_rich_v2_wf_st - only WF and spike-timing with the summary statistics and NO individual chunk values
*results_rf_280722_rich_chance_balanced_fix_imp - chance level for rich with saving of raw importances
*results_rf_240522_spatial - I am not sure but I think it was the spatial with the amplitude based (could also be local median)
*results_rf_290322 - The original run
*results_rf_290322_fix_imp - Rerunning the pervious one while saving raw importances
*results_rf_290322_gs - Doing the gs on chunks as well with limited number of trained samples (also used only 2 parameters)
*results_rf_290322_more_chunks_5 - Crushed because chunk size = 1 was too much, this is only after 5 iterations
*results_rf_290322_more_chunks_wo1 - only spatial with chunk sizes of 5 and 10
*results_rf_290322_rich - the addition of the distribution features
*results_rf_290322_rich_fix_imp - rerunning the regular rich while saving raw importances

The following were created by the script in combine_res.py:
*results_rf_combined - combining regular no chunking and the full chunking
*results_rf_combined_chance_balanced - baseline for the previous one
results_rf_combined_v2 - combining all of the V2 chunking things
*results_rf_events - full chunking with importance grouped for events
*results_rf_events_chance_balanced - baseline for the previous one
*results_rf_moments - full chunking with importance grouped by moments
*results_rf_moments_chance_balanced - baseline for the previous one
*results_rf_spatial_combined - basic chunking for spatial but also with chunk sizes 10 and 5.
